        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Enthusiastic software developer. Passionate about learning and solving complex problems. Ready to grow in a professional environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Hive Helsinki, I explored a wide range of challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            I built a web server using C++. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I implemented a Dining Philosophers simulation using multithreading. I also created a custom Unix shell with multiprocessing—both in C.
        </p>
        <p>
            I developed a School Management API with Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. I also built a dynamic travel suggestions website using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            I value the experience of senior developers. I am a good listener, eager to learn from others. I am a team player who values collaboration. I thrive in environments that encourage autonomy and initiative. I am excited to focus my skills in a professional setting. Ready to contribute and tackle new challenges.
